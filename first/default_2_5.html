				The Bharatiya Janata Party,'Indian People's Party', BJP is a political party in
			    India and one of the two major Indian political parties alongside the Indian
			    National Congress. BJP emerged out from Syama Prasad Mukherjee's Bharatiya Jana
			    Sangh. Since 2014, it has been the ruling political party in India under the 
			    incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The BJP is aligned with right-wing
			    politics and has close ideological and organisational links to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak
			    Sangh (RSS), a far-right paramilitary organisation. Its policies adhere to 
			    Hindutva, a Hindu nationalist ideology. As of January 2024, it is the country's 
			    biggest political party in terms of representation in the Parliament of India as
			    well as state legislatures.

                The party's origins lie in the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, which was founded in 1951 by 
                Indian politician Syama Prasad Mukherjee, after he left Hindu Mahasabha to form a
                party as the political wing of RSS. After the Emergency of 1975–1977, the Jana
                Sangh merged with several other political parties to form the Janata Party; it 
                defeated the then-incumbent Indian National Congress in the 1977 general election.
                After three years in power, the Janata Party dissolved in 1980, with the members of 
                the erstwhile Jana Sangh reconvening to form the modern-day BJP. Although initially
                unsuccessful—winning only two seats in the 1984 general election, it grew in
                strength on the back of the movement around Ram Janmabhoomi in Uttar Pradesh.
                Following victories in several state elections and better performances in nationalelections, the BJP became the largest political party in the Parliament in 1996;however.</p>

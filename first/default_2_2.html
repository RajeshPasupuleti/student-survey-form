				Shivaji I (Shivaji Shahaji Bhonsale,19 February 1630 â€“ 3 April 1680) was an Indian ruler
			    and a member of the Bhonsle dynasty. Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom from
			    the Sultanate of Bijapur that formed the genesis of the Maratha Confederacy. In 1674, he 
			    was formally crowned the Chhatrapati of his realm at Raigad Fort.
                Shivaji offered passage and his service to the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to invade the
                declining Sultanate of Bijapur. After Aurangzeb's departure for the north due to a war
                of succession, Shivaji conquered territories ceded by Bijapur in the name of the
                Mughals. Following his defeat at the hands of Jai Singh I in the Battle of Purandar,
                Shivaji entered into vassalage with the Mughal empire, assuming the role of a Mughal
                chief and was conferred with the title of Raja by Aurangzeb. He undertook military
                expeditions on behalf of the Mughal empire for a brief duration. Over the course of
                his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire, the
                Sultanate of Golconda, the Sultanate of Bijapur and the European colonial powers.
                In 1674, Shivaji was crowned as the king despite opposition from local Brahmins. Praised
                for his chivalrous treatment of women, Shivaji employed people of all castes and
                religions, including Muslims and Europeans, in his administration and armed forces.
                Shivaji's military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and
                building forts, and forming a Maratha navy.
                Shivaji's legacy was revived by Jyotirao Phule about two centuries after his death.
                Later on, he came to be glorified by Indian nationalists such as Bal Gangadhar Tilak,
                and appropriated by Hindutva activists.Shivaji was born in the hill-fort of Shivneri, near Junnar, which is now in Pune district. Scholars disagree on his date of birth; the Government of Maharashtra lists 19 February as a holiday commemorating Shivaji's birth (Shivaji Jayanti).[a][27][28] Shivaji was named after a local deity, the Goddess Shivai Devi.Shivaji belonged to a Maratha family of the Bhonsle clan.</p>

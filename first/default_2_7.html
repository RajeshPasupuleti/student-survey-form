				India, officially the Republic of India, is a country in South Asia. It is
			    the seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country from June 2023 
			    onwards; and since its independence in 1947, the world's most populous democracy. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on
			    the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with
			    Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and
			    Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is near Sri Lanka and the Maldives;
			    its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and
			    Indonesia.

                Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000
                years ago. Their long occupation, predominantly in isolation as
                hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in
                human genetic diversity.[31] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the
                western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into
                the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE. By 1200 BCE, an
                archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from
                the northwest. Its hymns recorded the dawning of Hinduism in India.
                India's pre-existing Dravidian languages were supplanted in the northern
                regions. By 400 BCE, caste had emerged within Hinduism, and Buddhism and
                Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity. Early
                political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires.
                Widespread creativity suffused this era,[40] but the status of women declined,
                and untouchability became an organized belief.</p>

				The first verifiable claim for a practically used bicycle belongs to German 
			    Baron Karl von Drais Sauerbronn, a civil servant to the Grand Duke of Baden
			    in Germany. Drais invented his Laufmaschine (German for "running machine") 
			    in 1817, that was called Draisine (English) or draisienne (French) by the press.
			    Karl von Drais patented this design in 1818, which was the first commercially 
			    successful two-wheeled, steerable, human-propelled machine, commonly called a 
			    velocipede, and nicknamed hobby-horse or dandy horse.[11] It was initially 
			    manufactured in Germany and France.The first verifiable claim for a practically used bicycle belongs to German

				The Janasena Party ('People's Army Party'; abbr. JSP) is an Indian political party active in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Founded by Pawan Kalyan on 14 March 2014, it is currently the second largest party in the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly and a partner in the ruling coalition. Pawan Kalyan, the party leader, has been serving as the Deputy Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh since June 2024. Janasena advocates for a centrist approach with a focus on humanism. The party's election symbol is a glass tumbler.Janasena did not contest the 2014 elections, but its support was crucial for the victory of the TDP-BJP alliance in Andhra Pradesh. The party gained prominence for highlighting issues such as the chronic kidney disease crisis in Uddanam in 2017, which was described by the WHO as "the least understood and the least publicized nephropathy." It later led protests against forced land acquisition, illegal mining in reserved forests, and drought-related issues in 2018.In 2019, JSP contested its first elections, winning one MLA seat and securing approximately 6% of the vote share. Subsequently, it focused on grassroots issues, including farmer welfare, illegal sand mining, women's safety, and land encroachment. In early 2024, Pawan Kalyan played a key role in the formation of an alliance between the JSP, TDP and BJP, known as Kūṭami ('Alliance'). The alliance achieved a landslide victory in both the general and state legislative assembly elections, with the JSP winning all 21 MLA seats and two MP seats it contested, becoming a significant part of the ruling coalition in Andhra Pradesh.Janasena did not contest the 2014 elections, but its support was crucial for the victory of the TDP-BJP alliance in Andhra Pradesh.</p>
